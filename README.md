# PyPSSH

**PyPSSH** is a lightweight Python tool to extract and base64-encode Widevine and PlayReady PSSH boxes from MP4 initialization segments. It's designed for DRM diagnostics, license server debugging, and media pipeline automation.

## üöÄ Features

- Extracts Widevine and PlayReady PSSH boxes from MP4 initialization segments.
- Outputs PSSH boxes in base64 encoding for easy use.
- Can be used for debugging DRM workflows or extracting information from encrypted media files.
- Simple and efficient with minimal dependencies.

## üß∞ Usages

### Command Line Usage
To extract Widevine and PlayReady PSSH boxes from an MP4 initialization segment, run the script as follows:

```bash
python3 pypssh.py init.mp4
```

The script will output the base64-encoded PSSH boxes for both Widevine and PlayReady (if present).

### Developer Usage
You can also import the script as a module and use the `extract_pssh()` function to get the PSSH boxes programmatically. Here's an example of how to use the function in your own Python code:

```python
from pssh_extractor import PSSH
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(message)s')
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Specify the path to the video initialization segment
video_file_path = '/path/to/video_init.mp4'  # Replace with the actual path

# Parse the PSSH data from the file
pssh = PSSH.parse(video_file_path)

logger.info("Extracted PSSH Data:")
logger.info("--------------------")

# Extract and log Widevine & PlayReady PSSH base64 data if available
widevine_b64 = pssh.get_widevine_b64()
playready_b64 = pssh.get_playready_b64()

if widevine_b64:
    logger.info(f"Widevine PSSH: {widevine_b64}")
else:
    logger.info("No Widevine PSSH found")

if playready_b64:
    logger.info(f"PlayReady PSSH: {playready_b64}")
else:
    logger.info("No PlayReady PSSH found")
```
